Parrot-Status - Zik 2

Status Item for the Parrot Zik 2. This is a fork of Vincent Le Normand's initial Parrot Status for Parrot Zik first generation (https://github.com/vincent-le-normand/Parrot-Status).

Download
========

There is no compiled version at the moment. You will have to compile it yourself I'm afraid, although I might provide one when I am happy enough with it (which might take some time).

Installation
============

To install the software, compile it then drag it onto your Application Folder.
